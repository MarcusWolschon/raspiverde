# raspiverde
**Purpose:** Hacking a (bankrupt) Bonaverde "Berlin" <u>roasting</u>, grinding and brewing coffee machine to be controlled by a Raspberry Pi instead of (fallback) NFC memory cards and a (now defunct) Android app.
Since the mobile phone SIM card inside the device is no longer functional,
this seems to be a reasonable way of making use of these existing machines.

**Project Status:** WIP,
