The [hackaverde project](https://github.com/PostalBlab/hackaverde/tree/master/images) also has some high quality images of the PCBs including the front panel.

## power supply box

After disassembly we saw a power distribution box on the water-reservoir side.

It has outputs

* Output-N - thick blue cable - to electronics box
* OP-N1 - thick blue cable - to water heater
* OP-N2 - thick white cable - to 700W roasting lamp (other think white cable comes from electronics box)
* OP-N3..N5 - front panel electronics (?)
* OP-N5 - 2 thin yellow cables - to roasting turntable
* OP-N6 - thin black - to electronics box

## relay box

<img src="..\Bonaverde_disassembly\opened_right.JPG" alt="opened_right" style="zoom:12%;" />

The box has a screw on the bottom of the side and 2 obvious push fit connectors.
It can be opened without detaching the front panel.
It seems to get lower power signals from the front panel and switch the different high power elements.
So it seems like we can attach ourself to that ribbon cable instead of the front panel to control this machine without having to touch any high power electronics ourself.![relay_box_front](C:\Users\mw2_7\Documents\GitHub\raspiverde\interfacing_electronics\relay_box_front.JPG)

### CN21

This connector seems to be our power supply for the front panel.
It should also serve as a nice power supply for our new Raspberry Pi.

* Black = GND
* White = -5V
* Red = -24V

### CN9

This 10x2 ribbon cable seems to do contain all the control signals we need to attach to.
