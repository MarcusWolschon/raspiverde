The [hackaverde project](https://github.com/PostalBlab/hackaverde/tree/master/images) also has some high quality images of the PCBs including the front panel.

## power supply box

After disassembly we saw a power distribution box on the water-reservoir side.

It has outputs

* Output-N - thick blue cable - to electronics box
* OP-N1 - thick blue cable - to water heater
* OP-N2 - thick white cable - to 700W roasting lamp (other think white cable comes from electronics box)
* OP-N3..N5 - front panel electronics (?)
* OP-N6 - 2 thin yellow cables - to 230V 6W grinding motor
* OP-N6 - thin black - to electronics box

## relay box

The box has a screw on the bottom of the side and 2 obvious push fit connectors.
It can be opened without detaching the front panel.
It seems to get lower power signals from the front panel and switch the different high power elements.
So it seems like we can attach ourself to that ribbon cable instead of the front panel to control this machine without having to touch any high power electronics ourself.
