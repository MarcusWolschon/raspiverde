## inspecting the machine

Here are the locations of all of the screws reachable from the outside.

For the screws on the back side, you'll have to pry out two plastic covers.

The screws marked in green should stay in place for the time being.

## opening the top

1. detach the power cord

2. detach water reservoir, glass jug, filter holder, roasting tray and air filter

3. in the top of the holes for air filter and water reservoir, you'll find 2 PH2 screws each. Remove these.

4. You can now take off the top by sliding in the spatula to release the push fit connectors running along all 4 walls.

## the walls

* The side walls slides into the back from the top.
* The front wall slide into the sides from the top.

With the respective screws from the sides and bottom removed, we can slide the back wall up.
This may require some force.
The location of the 6 screws is indicated in the photo below.

## Detaching the sides

In addition to the 4 screws on the bottom, holding the side,
you'll find 2 more on the inside.

After removing those (and lifting the air-filter side clear of the air duct),
you can slide up the sides with some force.
Be careful to not cut yourself on any of the the sheet-metal parts.

## Looking inside

At this point the machinery is well exposed and we should be able to reach everything on the inside in obvious ways.
You'll find two (cased) electronics boxes on the inside.
A power supply on the water-reservoir side and an high power relay electronics box on the air-filter side.
The [hackaverde project](https://github.com/PostalBlab/hackaverde/tree/master/images) also has some high quality images of the PCBs including the front panel.
